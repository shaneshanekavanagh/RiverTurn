# RiverTurn
Simple River Raft experience

Project was originally made in Unity 4, upgraded to 2022.3.12f1 with OpenXR. There's so many things that can be optimised, but it's a nice snap shot of what it's meant to be. Water is still a pain in VR, might need to get an asset, but the lowPoly water works for the moment.
